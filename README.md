# Developer-Trends-report
This data analysis project explores developer demographics, programming language trends, and job satisfaction using real-world survey data from Stack Overflow. It involves data cleaning, transformation, and visualization using Python and Google Looker Studio.

üíª Developer Survey Analysis
An end-to-end data analytics project leveraging the Stack Overflow Developer Survey to uncover insights on developer demographics, tools, compensation, and job satisfaction.

üß† Objective
This project aims to extract meaningful trends and actionable insights from the Stack Overflow Developer Survey dataset. The primary goal is to explore the relationships between developers‚Äô demographics (age, education, country), professional attributes (employment type, experience), and preferences (languages, databases, tools). The analysis supports career planning for developers and decision-making for hiring managers, educators, and industry stakeholders.

üì¶ Dataset
Source: Stack Overflow Developer Survey (CSV format)
Volume: Large, unstructured dataset with missing values, multi-label entries (e.g., languages), and inconsistent formats.

üîß Methodology
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Removed duplicates and handled missing values through imputation (e.g., filling with mode or median)
- Mapped categorical ranges (e.g., Age) into numeric formats for analysis
- Flattened multi-response columns like LanguageHaveWorkedWith using string splitting and list comprehension
- Removed outliers in numeric columns (e.g., compensation) using IQR and standard deviation methods
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Frequency analysis of key categorical columns (e.g., Employment, MainBranch, RemoteWork)
- Correlation analysis (Pearson) between numeric features like job satisfaction and experience
- Aggregation and grouping by age group, country, and experience

Visualizations
- Histograms, box plots, pie charts, scatter plots, bubble plots, and stacked bar charts using Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Word cloud charts and hierarchy bubble charts via Google Looker Studio
- Dashboard Creation (Looker Studio)
- Multi-panel interactive dashboard with:
- Country-wise respondent distribution
- Language & database preferences (current vs desired)
- Compensation analysis by age and employment type
- Job satisfaction vs experience trends

üìä Key Insights
- Python, JavaScript, and SQL are among the most used and admired programming languages
- Younger developers (18‚Äì34) dominate the dataset, with distinct tool and tech preferences
- Job satisfaction tends to increase with professional experience, but not linearly
- Respondents working in full-time roles report higher median compensation
- Remote work is prevalent, with many respondents in hybrid setups
- A small group of outliers earns disproportionately high compensation, highlighting industry gaps

üõ† Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Google Looker Studio
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
- CSV & Excel for data handling
- GitHub for version control and hosting

üìÅ Deliverables
- Cleaned and processed dataset
- Visualizations and charts (static and interactive)
- Google Looker dashboard
- Executive summary with findings
- Slide deck with interpretation and business implications
- GitHub repository for portfolio inclusion

üåç Real-World Application
This project simulates a real-world analytics workflow ‚Äî from messy data to clean insights ‚Äî and demonstrates critical skills in data wrangling, visualization, stakeholder reporting, and storytelling. It can serve as a portfolio piece for roles in:

- Data analysis
- Business intelligence
- People analytics
- Developer relations and hiring strategy
